Installation Guide
Prerequisites
Before running the bot, make sure you have the following installed:

## Python 3.7 or higher
Git (for cloning the repository)
## Step-by-Step Installation

1. Clone the Repository
First, you need to clone the repository to your local machine. Open a terminal and run:
```sh
git clone https://github.com/Kazuha787/Unich-Daily-Bot.git
```

This will create a local copy of the repository.

3. Navigate to the Project Directory
Once the repository is cloned, navigate to the project directory:
```sh
cd Unich-Daily-Bot
```

3. Set Up Authentication
The bot requires a Bearer Token to interact with the Unich platform. Youâ€™ll need to create a file called auth.txt and add your token to it.

Create the auth.txt file:
```sh
nano auth.txt
```

Inside auth.txt, paste your Bearer Token (you should get this from your Unich account or API documentation).
Save and close the file by pressing CTRL + X, then Y to confirm the changes.
4. Install Dependencies
Ensure that all necessary dependencies are installed. You can do this by running:
```sh
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
This will install all required libraries.

5. Run the Bot
Now you're ready to run the bot. Simply execute the following command:
```sh
python unich.py
```

The bot will begin its operation and start claiming FD Tokens automatically each day.

## How It Works
Authentication: The bot authenticates with the Unich platform using the Bearer Token stored in auth.txt.
Daily Claims: The bot will interact with the Unich platform on a daily basis to claim FD tokens.
Automation: Once the bot is running, it will continuously run in the background, claiming tokens as per the platform's specified schedule.
Troubleshooting
Invalid Bearer Token: If you receive an authentication error, ensure that the correct token is in auth.txt.
Missing Dependencies: If you encounter missing module errors, double-check that all dependencies are installed by running pip install -r requirements.txt.
